# Single_cell_RNA_sequencing_data_analysis_workflow

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files. One contains the code implemented in the scRNA-seq data analysis workflow of the human retina sample. 
The other contains the code implemented in the scRNA-seq data analysis workflow of the mouse retina sample.

All code implemented in both Jupyter Notebook files was adapted from https://colab.research.google.com/github/pachterlab/BBB/blob/master/notebooks/lung_atlas/mouse_lung_dropseq_SRR8426358_python.ipynb
